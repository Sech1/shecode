      <div class="content is-medium">
The field of Computer Science is an ever-growing field with growing numbers and variety of career opportunities. Even careers not normally associated with computing are increasingly making use of computing and technology. For a variety of reasons, women tend to participate in the study of computing and computing careers less than men.

At SheCode we aim to provide a way to get young women interested in the field before they even step foot on a college campus. The SheCode event invites female middle school and high school students to SIUE to participate in a programming project and learn more about computing. We will bring professional women in computing careers to SIUE to mentor the participants.

By providing the mentorship and experience to get started in computing we hope SheCode will give young women and chance to experience Computer Science.

        <p>Whether you're a master programmer or have never touched a computer you'll come away from SheCode with a new appreciation for the field of Computer Science. At SheCode you'll be working closely with a team of your peers and a mentor to create an app. Each of the mentors is an SIUE Computer Science Alumnae and a professional in the technology field. At the end of the day you will walk away with an app on your phone that you created from scratch. Show your friends and family what you have learned and continue to do it.</p>

        <p>The field of Computer Science is an ever-growing field with limitless opportunities. However, there is great lack of women. This creates the perfect opportunity for women seeking to enter Computer Science but they still need the skills. At SheCode we aim to provide a way to get young women interested in the field before they even step foot on a college campus. By providing the mentorship and experience to get started we hope SheCode will give your daughter the push to consider Computer Science in the future.</p>
